- Refactor ISerializationOptions interface to unify member serialization policies and enhance clarity. Introduce new properties for serialization and deserialization policies, and update related enums for improved configurability. ([@matt-edmondson](https://github.com/matt-edmondson))
- Add ISerializationOptions interface and related policies for serialization configuration ([@matt-edmondson](https://github.com/matt-edmondson))
- Update global.json and Abstractions.csproj to use ktsu.Sdk version 1.60.0 and switch project SDK to Microsoft.NET.Sdk, improving compatibility with .NET 8.0. ([@matt-edmondson](https://github.com/matt-edmondson))
- Refactor ISerializationProvider interface to use generic type parameters for deserialization methods, enhancing type safety and usability. Update CompatibilitySuppressions.xml to remove obsolete suppressions related to nullable attributes, ensuring compatibility with .NET 8.0. ([@matt-edmondson](https://github.com/matt-edmondson))
- Update CompatibilitySuppressions.xml to reflect changes in diagnostic IDs and target methods for the ktsu.Abstractions library, enhancing compatibility with .NET 8.0. This includes updates for compression, encryption, hashing, and obfuscation methods, ensuring accurate suppression of diagnostics across versions.
